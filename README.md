# 365-Days-Java-Challenge
---
A year I set for myself to learn the whole Java language and probably complete some publicly available projects.
This repo is the compilation of files for my 1-year java programming journey. From learning in-depth programming through java and possibly creating some projects.

**May 7, 2018 (Day 25)**
- Day 1 of my personal project using java.
- The project is an open source software that aims to be an alternative to commercial softwares in the market for hydraulic calculations.
- I started structuring the project and the library at day 1 trying to make something work for MVP and it did.

**May 8, 2018 (Day 26)**
- Continue work on the library and incorporating some implementations.
- I also started writing exception handling at this stage. I don't know when you should be doing that but I did it anyway.

**May 9, 2018 (Day 27)**
- Continue work on IrrigFlo (My java project)
- Improve the exception handling
- Added two (2) constructors for RectangularOpenChannel class, 1st with unknown as parameter, 2nd is unknown and the rest of inputs.
- This time I started to compile the library into a jar file and used in another project just to see if it works, it does.
- To add a little spice, the graphical user interface has been drafted.
